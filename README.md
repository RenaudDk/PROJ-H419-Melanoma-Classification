# PROJ-H419-Melanoma-Classification
 "This repository presents a first approach to tackle the ISIC 2020 Challenge on melanoma classification. The challenge can be found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification) and all the datasets can be found there too. Furthermore, this notebook is widely inspired by Kaggle courses on computer vision (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision) and tensorflow tutorials (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials).
